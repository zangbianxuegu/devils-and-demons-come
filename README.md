# devils-and-demons-come

日蓮大聖人《立正安國論》中說：

> 夫出家入道者，总期依法成佛，然今神术不显，佛威不验，具观当世之体，愚而启后生之疑。然则仰圆覆以吞恨，俯方载而深虑，试抒微见，聊披经文，则知世皆背正，人悉归恶。故、善神舍国而去，圣人辞所不还。是以，魔来鬼来，灾起难起。不可不言，不可不恐！

> When a man leaves family life and enters the Buddhist way, it is because he hopes to attain Buddhahood through the teachings of the Buddha. But attempts now to move the gods fail to have any effect, and appeals to the power of the Buddhas produce no results. When I observe carefully the state of the world today, I see people who give way to doubt because of the lack of understanding [on the part of eminent priests]. They look up at the heavens and mouth their resentment, or gaze down at the earth and sink deep into despair.

> I have pondered the matter carefully with what limited resources I possess, and have looked a little at the scriptures for an answer. The people of today all turn their backs upon what is right; to a person, they give their allegiance to evil. This is the reason that the benevolent deities have abandoned the nation and departed together, that sages leave and do not return. And in their stead devils and demons come, and disasters and calamities occur. I cannot keep silent on this matter. I cannot suppress my fears.
